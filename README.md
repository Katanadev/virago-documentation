# What is Virago?

Virago is a decentralized exchange running on Binance Smart Chain and Pancakeswap exchange, with lots of other features that let you earn and win tokens.

What we are trying to do is create a perpetual deflation token, VIR, that allows a constant price pump with a sufficient burn mechanism. We are not trying to replace the swap & exchange but to add value into the system and create a suitable and sustainable environment for people to stake with high APR.


# Features

We hope to create a VIR Token for everyone to farm from it! Earn VIR Tokens, and other coins (to be determined) while staking.


# Security (TBD)

 Migrator code Removed (inherited from Pancakeswap)
